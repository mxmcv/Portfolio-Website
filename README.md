# Portfolio Website

I designed and developed my personal portfolio website to showcase my professional background and personal projects. Built using HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, the site features a clean, modern UI with a responsive design, including a day and night mode toggle to enhance user experience. The website is organized into several sections: an 'About Me' page that outlines my skills and basic information, a 'Resume' page displaying my work experience and educational history, a 'My Works' page where I highlight my projects and provide additional resources, and a 'Contact Me' page equipped with a contact form for easy communication. 
This portfolio not only serves as a professional representation of my capabilities but also as a functional and visually appealing digital space for potential employers and collaborators to explore my work.
